This is a fork of the template CS Projects Semester 1 2018 project to
share files between the student, project supervisor and course
convenor.

It contains the empty pdf files:
  initPresent.pdf finalPresent.pdf report.pdf artefacts.zip
  
These should be replaced by the pdf files for your initial
presentation, final presentation, report and project artefacts zipfile
respectively.  The updated repository must be `pushed' back into your
gitlab project repository.  This must occur before the file's
respective due date.

If you want to incrementally add artefacts, instead of artefacts.zip,
you may instead use the directory
  artefacts
If you use this option, similarly the final files inside this directory
must be `pushed' back into gitlab, before the artefact's due date.

Using the zipfile for the artefacts has the advantage of simplicity.
The advantage of using the directory is it allows sharing of files
(e.g. with the supervisor) as they are added, and can potentially
avoid a single large `push' at the last moment.

Please do ***not*** move or rename any of these files! Just replace
(overwrite) the pdf and zip files and add to the artefacts directory

Please do not put any files or data irrelevant to your project in this
area.
